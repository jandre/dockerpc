# dockerpc

`dockerpc` enables JSON-RPC over Docker plugins.

This project was inspired by the [pie plugin architecture](https://github.com/natefinch/pie).

Like `pie`, it enables you to create an JSON-RPC plugin communication over standard in/standard out,
however, it uses Docker containers as `pie` plugin providers.
